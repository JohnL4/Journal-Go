** Typescript definite assignment

   Got compiler errors from the theme-switch post below.  Basically, I think we need to convince the compiler that

   #+BEGIN_SRC tide
     options$: Observable<Array<Option>> = this.themeService.getThemeOptions();
   #+END_SRC

   Never assigns a null to =options$=.  Or possibly, that =themeService.getThemeOptions()= never returns a null.

   Looks like the statement of the problem is here: https://angular.io/guide/template-typecheck#strict-null-checks.

*** How I solved it

    The problem is the =async= operator.  On a fundamental level, we're getting the list of theme options from the
    server, and there's no guarantee the server API call has returned yet.  In that case, when =async= is evaluated,
    it's forced to return null, so we could wind up with a null.

    I could wrap the entire =async= pipeline in a definite-assignment assertion, as follows:

    : <app-menu [options]="(options$ | async)!" (themeChange)="themeChangeHandler($event)">

    and that makes the compiler error go away, but it doesn't make the null situation go away (and we'll probably still
    be getting a null from =async= b/c the server will not have returned yet).  Maybe that's fine?  Maybe this is just
    compiler warnings and we can just be slack and say "trust us, we'll get a definite value"?

** Specify input and output from components

   Decorate the class /member/ with =@Input()= or =@Output()=, not the class.

** DONE Make a bunch of stupid synthetic journal-editor options
   CLOSED: [2023-07-30 Sun 13:40]

** Lay the journal-editor widgets out in some sort of responsive grid

   I think what I'm going to call "Andy Bell's one line of CSS" should do the trick.  Basically, you specify a minimum
   cell width and tell CSS to lay the grid out by filling rows first (the default behavior), adding columns as
   necessary, until the columns get too small; then move to the next row.  So you get a layout like this:

   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   | 7 | 8 | 9 |

   (i.e., basically row-major grid filling)

   There's no neat way to do it in column-major order because you'd have to fix the height of the grid to some absolute
   value, which is just ugly, imo.

   I tried the Material Grid List, but that requires a fixed number of columns.  I suppose I /could/ write some
   TypeScript to figure out viewport width or something, but mat-grid-list really seems to be oriented toward things
   that can tolerate being squeezed or clipped (e.g., images or prose that can be truncated).  That's not true for text
   labels and form controls, so I think mat-grid-list is fundamentally the wrong choice.

   Maybe this?
   https://medium.com/motf-creations/migrate-from-css-to-scss-stylesheets-for-existing-angular-application-d61f8061f5b7

   The easy way documented in that article didn't quite work, but I think I was able to do it by hand.

   The problem was that /some/ =.scss= files existed already, so the tools refused to work.  They could maybe be made
   smarter, but not by me (at least, not right now).

*** DONE App reloads after setting theme, negating effect of setting style
    CLOSED: [2023-06-29 Thu 19:12]

    - CLOSING NOTE [2023-06-29 Thu 19:12] \\
      The problem was that I didn't have a path set up in my Go app for requests to urls starting with "/node_modules".  So,
      the Go app was returning the default path, =index.html=.
      
      Once I set up that path in Go, as below, it works fine.
      
      : r.Static("/node_modules", "./ng/node_modules")

      btw, This won't work with shipping product, since it's essentially pulling the predefined themes straight out of
      the dev folder's =node_modules= subdirectory.  We'd need to find a different way if we took this approach, plus we
      want the user to (maybe) define their own color scheme?  Maybe?
      #----------------------------------------------------------------

    After implementing the final step of this guide, I see the app reloading =index.html=, basically negating the
    effect. :(

*** DONE Need to load initially with my chosen lightblue-orange theme
    CLOSED: [2023-07-06 Thu 18:06]

    - CLOSING NOTE [2023-07-06 Thu 18:06]
    Turns out header-component's =ngOnInit()= loads the purple-amber color theme by default, at
    startup.  I can (at the moment) simply comment that out, so no theme is "loaded" on init, which
    leaves the theme I created in the root =styles.scss= in place, my lightblue-orange theme.

**** DONE Problem with typography and density not being active at first
     CLOSED: [2023-07-07 Fri 22:52]

     I got the colors to load, but the typography/density is off (still user browser default; also no good if I hammer
     in Roboto as the body font in =styles.scss=).

     Need to get a full theme in play.

     Installed @angular/material with the following options:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        C:\Users\John\Development\go\Journal\ng> ng add @angular/material
       Skipping installation: Package already installed
       ? Choose a prebuilt theme name, or "custom" for a custom theme: Custom
       ? Set up global Angular Material typography styles? Yes
       ? Include the Angular animations module? Include and enable animations
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     After that, I didn't need to add =mat-typography= to my =body= element, but the typography is still different from
     the prebuilt themes.

     */BUT ALSO:/* Selecting "global" (I think) caused the behavior of the /prebuilt/ themes to change so now the
     typography matches.  (Maybe the prebuilt themes didn't have a typography settings, so they inherited the global
     setting???)
   
** Auto light/dark theming

   https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#multiple-themes-in-one-file

** Sidenav

   https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/overview

   Imports go in =app.module.ts=.

** How to add a new material component to the app

   Where does the styling go?

   General styling goes in either the top-level =styles.scss= or =custom-theme.scss=.

   Don't forget to =@include mat.<component>-theme= when you use a new Material component.

** Elevation (?) issues

   My toolbar menu isn't coming up on top of my toolbar, but, rather, underneath it.

   [[file:material-menu-weirdness.png][file:material-menu-weirdness.png]]

   But I think the problem might be that I didn't =@include= the mat-menu style.

   It wasn't actually an elevation issue, but including the styles (or themes, whatever) did the trick.

** Icons

   The indepth.dev post uses the Material Google fonts.  They actually work by specifying ligatures, which normally
   means combinations like "fi" are replaced by a different glyph (maybe zoom in on the occurrence in this web page to
   see it in action).  There's no reason, as a font maker, you can't specify another ligature for a sequence of letters
   like "home" such that, when they occur, you replace them with their own glyph that looks like a house.

   So, the fonts are included in your web page by adding the following to your =index.html=, in the =head= section:

   : <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">

   Then you can include something like the following somewhere in your app:

   : <mat-icon class="icon">menu</mat-icon>

   (Note this is only set up for /icons/ right now, not symbols, apparently.)

** Columns of components (column-major layout)

   How to display more columns in wide-screen than in narrow.  Column-major order, basically.

** DONE Make the toolbar stick to the top of the window/viewport
   CLOSED: [2023-07-08 Sat 12:54]


   Use Angular Material elevation helpers, but those only affect shadows, not =z-index= (I guess they want to be
   conservative in their assumptions of the app's actual layers).  You can also explicitly set =z-index= in your
   stylesheet for the component.

   =position= and =top= work to make the toolbar stick, but without =z-index=, the content below still scrolls over the
   toolbar.  It's kind of weird, and I don't fully understand it.

   #+CAPTION: component html
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <mat-toolbar color="primary" class="mat-elevation-z4">
   #+END_SRC 

   #+CAPTION: component stylesheet (.scss)
   #+BEGIN_SRC scss
     mat-toolbar {
         position: sticky;
         top: 0;
         z-index: 4;
     }
   #+END_SRC 

** RESEARCH-DONE What is the behavior of Angular components in web page DOM?
   CLOSED: [2023-07-08 Sat 11:38]

   Chrome browser dev tools reports Angular components as DOM elements of their own (e.g., "mat-toolbar").  Are these
   DIV elements?  Or just attribute-free elements?  If the latter, how are they laid out (e.g., block context vs. flow

   Looks like the answer is "arbitrary elements are /autonomous custom elements/, and they inherit from Element."  See
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements.

   I don't think it has layout properties, so the browser is blind to it, but it /can/ have a class name (or list of).
   Interestingly, it can't have a =style= attribute, although =HTMLElement= /can/.

** Datepicker label not properly nestled in field

   The label is sitting too high, so when I pick a date, the label gets pushed up under the topbar.

   Note: the solution here was to include some more SASS modules.  (Specifically, =form-field= and =input=.)  See commit

* Animated SVG for hamburger menu

  (This turned out to be a little stupid, so I dropped it.)

** DONE Need to animate hamburger-to-left-arrow and back
   CLOSED: [2023-07-08 Sat 16:09]

   - CLOSING NOTE [2023-07-08 Sat 16:09] \\
     I got it done, but:
        a. It's too big and doesn't use the toolbar's foreground color; and
        b. The javascript/animated CSS/whatever doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy 8.
     So, maybe just ditch this fluorish.

   SVG animation thing?

** TODO Run on my AWS EC instance

*** TODO Update firewall rules to allow connection on a different port

    8080, maybe? Or 6060?

    Consult my own Amazon notes at http://tarheel-nc.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/using-aws.html.  (I did look at
    this, but there's nothing about network config and firewalls or security groups or whatever is required.)

**** TODO Current ports in use

*** TODO Update Go code to use non-default connection config

    Different port /and/ allow connections from the world at large.

    Gin options, I'm sure.

** DevOps CI/CD

   GitHub Actions?

   Something in GitLab?

   Monitor & pull from EC instance?  Chef?  Puppeteer?  Something entirely different?

** Authentication/session management

   JWT?  Yes.

   A little quick googling (=go gin security=) yields this:
