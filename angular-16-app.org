** Typescript definite assignment

   Got compiler errors from the theme-switch post below.  Basically, I think we need to convince the compiler that

   #+BEGIN_SRC tide
     options$: Observable<Array<Option>> = this.themeService.getThemeOptions();
   #+END_SRC

   Never assigns a null to =options$=.  Or possibly, that =themeService.getThemeOptions()= never returns a null.

   Looks like the statement of the problem is here: https://angular.io/guide/template-typecheck#strict-null-checks.

*** How I solved it

    The problem is the =async= operator.  On a fundamental level, we're getting the list of theme options from the
    server, and there's no guarantee the server API call has returned yet.  In that case, when =async= is evaluated,
    it's forced to return null, so we could wind up with a null.

    I could wrap the entire =async= pipeline in a definite-assignment assertion, as follows:

    : <app-menu [options]="(options$ | async)!" (themeChange)="themeChangeHandler($event)">

    and that makes the compiler error go away, but it doesn't make the null situation go away (and we'll probably still
    be getting a null from =async= b/c the server will not have returned yet).  Maybe that's fine?  Maybe this is just
    compiler warnings and we can just be slack and say "trust us, we'll get a definite value"?

** Specify input and output from components

   Decorate the class /member/ with =@Input()= or =@Output()=, not the class.

   Maybe this?
   https://medium.com/motf-creations/migrate-from-css-to-scss-stylesheets-for-existing-angular-application-d61f8061f5b7

   The easy way documented in that article didn't quite work, but I think I was able to do it by hand.

   The problem was that /some/ =.scss= files existed already, so the tools refused to work.  They could maybe be made
   smarter, but not by me (at least, not right now).

*** DONE App reloads after setting theme, negating effect of setting style
    CLOSED: [2023-06-29 Thu 19:12]

    - CLOSING NOTE [2023-06-29 Thu 19:12] \\
      The problem was that I didn't have a path set up in my Go app for requests to urls starting with "/node_modules".  So,
      the Go app was returning the default path, =index.html=.
      
      Once I set up that path in Go, as below, it works fine.
      
      : r.Static("/node_modules", "./ng/node_modules")

      btw, This won't work with shipping product, since it's essentially pulling the predefined themes straight out of
      the dev folder's =node_modules= subdirectory.  We'd need to find a different way if we took this approach, plus we
      want the user to (maybe) define their own color scheme?  Maybe?
      #----------------------------------------------------------------

    After implementing the final step of this guide, I see the app reloading =index.html=, basically negating the
    effect. :(

*** DONE Need to load initially with my chosen lightblue-orange theme
    CLOSED: [2023-07-06 Thu 18:06]

    - CLOSING NOTE [2023-07-06 Thu 18:06]
    Turns out header-component's =ngOnInit()= loads the purple-amber color theme by default, at
    startup.  I can (at the moment) simply comment that out, so no theme is "loaded" on init, which
    leaves the theme I created in the root =styles.scss= in place, my lightblue-orange theme.

**** DONE Problem with typography and density not being active at first
     CLOSED: [2023-07-07 Fri 22:52]

     I got the colors to load, but the typography/density is off (still user browser default; also no good if I hammer
     in Roboto as the body font in =styles.scss=).

     Need to get a full theme in play.

     Installed @angular/material with the following options:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        C:\Users\John\Development\go\Journal\ng> ng add @angular/material
       Skipping installation: Package already installed
       ? Choose a prebuilt theme name, or "custom" for a custom theme: Custom
       ? Set up global Angular Material typography styles? Yes
       ? Include the Angular animations module? Include and enable animations
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     After that, I didn't need to add =mat-typography= to my =body= element, but the typography is still different from
     the prebuilt themes.

     */BUT ALSO:/* Selecting "global" (I think) caused the behavior of the /prebuilt/ themes to change so now the
     typography matches.  (Maybe the prebuilt themes didn't have a typography settings, so they inherited the global
     setting???)
   
** Auto light/dark theming

   https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#multiple-themes-in-one-file

** Sidenav

   https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/overview

   Imports go in =app.module.ts=.

** How to add a new material component to the app

   Where does the styling go?

   General styling goes in either the top-level =styles.scss= or =custom-theme.scss=.

   Don't forget to =@include mat.<component>-theme= when you use a new Material component.

** Elevation (?) issues

   My toolbar menu isn't coming up on top of my toolbar, but, rather, underneath it.

   [[file:material-menu-weirdness.png][file:material-menu-weirdness.png]]

   But I think the problem might be that I didn't =@include= the mat-menu style.

   It wasn't actually an elevation issue, but including the styles (or themes, whatever) did the trick.

** Icons

   The indepth.dev post uses the Material Google fonts.  They actually work by specifying ligatures, which normally
   means combinations like "fi" are replaced by a different glyph (maybe zoom in on the occurrence in this web page to
   see it in action).  There's no reason, as a font maker, you can't specify another ligature for a sequence of letters
   like "home" such that, when they occur, you replace them with their own glyph that looks like a house.

   So, the fonts are included in your web page by adding the following to your =index.html=, in the =head= section:

   : <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">

   Then you can include something like the following somewhere in your app:

   : <mat-icon class="icon">menu</mat-icon>

   (Note this is only set up for /icons/ right now, not symbols, apparently.)

** Columns of components (column-major layout)

   How to display more columns in wide-screen than in narrow.  Column-major order, basically.

** TODO Make the toolbar stick to the top of the window/viewport

* Animated SVG (?)

** TODO Need to animate hamburger-to-left-arrow and back

   SVG animation thing?
